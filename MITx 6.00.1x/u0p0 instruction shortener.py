'''
Problem: copying Python instructions for these assignments doesn't fit into
the general 80 character limit.

Solution: more Python!

TO DO:
    âœ” Go back a few words and break on a space to keep words whole
    - Reset count on normal new line breaks

Idea for v2: interact with clipboard or other .py files

# I'm thinking it's easiest to have the big string field here
instructions = '''

The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,

gcd(2, 12) = 2

gcd(6, 12) = 6

gcd(9, 12) = 3

gcd(17, 12) = 1

Write an iterative function, gcdIter(a, b), that implements this idea. One easy way to do this is to begin with a test value equal to the smaller of the two input arguments, and iteratively reduce this test value by 1 until you either reach a case where the test divides both a and b without remainder, or you reach 1.
