'''
In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass 
as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. 
Assume that the user will input an integer.
'''

# get the user input. you forgot to make it an integer. it was even in the hints.
x = int(input('What number?\n'))
# that input now = input * formula for mass to joules
# okay I have no idea what their formula is but apparently it's just way over 9000
x = x*90000000000000000
# print it out! all done
print(x)
